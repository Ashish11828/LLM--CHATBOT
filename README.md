# LLM Chatbot

## Overview

The LLM Chatbot is a conversational AI system powered by a large language model (LLM), capable of understanding and generating human-like responses. This chatbot can be integrated into various applications to enhance user interactions with natural language understanding and processing.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Understands a wide range of queries in natural language.
- **Conversational AI**: Provides meaningful, context-aware responses.
- **Multilingual Support**: Capable of interacting in multiple languages.
- **Customizable**: Fine-tune the model for specific domains and tasks.
- **Integration Ready**: Can be integrated into web, mobile, or desktop applications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you install and run the LLM Chatbot, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Required dependencies (listed below)

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-chatbot.git
    cd llm-chatbot
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
    .\venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download or set up the LLM model** (if not preconfigured):
    - For models like GPT, download the model weights or access via an API such as OpenAI or Hugging Face.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the chatbot in the following ways:

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

1. Run the chatbot from the command line:
    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
    ```

2. Enter your queries, and the bot will respond in real-time.

### Integration with Web/ Mobile Apps

To integrate the chatbot into your application:

- **Web App (Flask/Django)**: 
  - Set up an endpoint to send requests to the chatbot's backend.
  - Example (Flask):
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
    from chatbot import Chatbot

    app = Flask(__name__)
    chatbot = Chatbot()

    @app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
    def chat():
        user_input = request.json['message']
        response = chatbot.get_response(user_input)
        return jsonify({'response': response})

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```

- **Mobile App (Flutter/React Native)**:
  - Send POST requests to your chatbot's server endpoint.
  - Display the response in a chat interface.

## Configuration

- **Model Parameters**: Modify model parameters like temperature, max tokens, etc., in the configuration file (`config.py`).
- **Custom Knowledge Base**: Integrate custom data to fine-tune the model's responses.

## Example Interaction

**User**: `What is the weather like today?`

**Bot**: `I'm not sure, but I can help you look it up!`

**User**: `What is the capital of France?`

**Bot**: `The capital of France is Paris.`
